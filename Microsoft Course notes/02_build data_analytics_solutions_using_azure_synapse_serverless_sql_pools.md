# 2. Build Data Analytics Solutions Using Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pools

As prerequisites for this learning path, Microsoft says to consider completing the following learning paths:
- [Explore data analytics in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-data-fundamentals-explore-data-warehouse-analytics/?azure-portal=true), which is part of the DP-900 syllabus. So if you've done DP-900, you've likely already done this.
- [Get Started Querying with Transact-SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-querying-with-transact-sql/). Something to consider if you're new to T-SQL (or to SQL in general), or if you want some practice with T-SQL. It's a bit long, though

> Note to self: update when this section is done how necessary/useful the T-SQL path is.

> This module is also part of the *Implement a Data Analytics Solution with Azure Synapse Analytics* learning path, see section 5.2. The notes for this module will be contained here.
